## AI Tools Used
- **Primary tools:** OpenAI’s GPT-4 (via ChatGPT/Cursor), GitHub Copilot
- **Key use cases:**  
  - Generating boilerplate code for Next.js and React components  
  - Refactoring and optimizing code for readability and performance  
  - Writing and updating documentation (README, setup instructions)  
  - Debugging and fixing linter/type errors  
  - Providing CSS/Tailwind solutions for responsive design  
  - Explaining code and suggesting best practices

## Sample Prompts (2-3 examples)
1. "Create a responsive React dashboard component with metric cards and charts."
2. "Help me fix linter errors in my Next.js project."
3. "Write a professional README with setup instructions and a feature overview for my analytics dashboard."

## AI vs Manual Work Split
- **AI-generated:**  
  Approximately 60–70% of the code and documentation was AI-assisted. This includes generating initial component structures, suggesting CSS/Tailwind classes, and drafting documentation. AI was also instrumental in troubleshooting errors and providing quick solutions for common issues.
- **Manual coding:**  
  Manual work focused on integrating and customizing the generated components, connecting mock data, fine-tuning UI/UX, and ensuring the dashboard met specific project requirements. I also handled project setup, dependency management, and final code reviews.
- **Customization:**  
  AI suggestions were adapted to fit the project’s branding, data structure, and user experience goals. I iteratively refined AI-generated code, adjusted layouts, and added custom logic to ensure the dashboard was both functional and visually appealing.
